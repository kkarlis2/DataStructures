Sorting and Priority Queues
Purpose of exercise is to become familiar with sorting algorithms and using priority 
queuing, one of the most basic data structures in algorithm design. The work concerns 
questions that, among other things, are encountered in simple recommendation 
systems, such as systems that recommend movies or series to subscribers based on a 
score on how suitable a movie is to a user. Here we will see another application, but 
again the algorithmic problem we want to solve is the same.
